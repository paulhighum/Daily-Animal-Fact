## APP OUTLINE

Backend database with at least two tables, one consisting of animal facts and another that stores comments posted by app users. The animal facts table includes images, animal name(s), animal scientific name, and a fact array.

Frontend grabs a random animal and a random fact, checks to make sure it is not a repeat animal from the past x amount of days, and then dynamically populates the page with the image, animal name, animal scientific name, a single random fact from the fact array, and any corresponding comments for that animal.
